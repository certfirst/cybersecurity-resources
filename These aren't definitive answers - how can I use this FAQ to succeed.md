## These aren't definitive answers - how can I use this FAQ to succeed?

[ tailor this section to any FAQ pages which need it; this example is education-centric ]

This FAQ doesn't give definitive answers because there aren't definitive answers. Many people start their careers in cybersecurity in a winding path, and there is no "correct" or "best" way. This FAQ will give you starting points, expert commentary, and things to consider.

You should use the information to help guide you to a solution that works best for your personal and professional development. To get the 'final' answers you are looking for, you'll almost certainly need to do some of your own research - such as searching for various security educational programs, evaluating jobs within and outside the cybersecurity field, practicing and studying on your own, and more.

If you are still unsure after doing research, or have questions which do not have appropriate starting guidance here, please bring your questions (and the research you've done so far) to r/cybersecurity's Mentorship Monday thread, or the subreddit r/SecurityCareerAdvice.
