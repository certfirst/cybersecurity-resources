## How much programming do cybersecurity professionals do?

**TL;DR:**
Depends on the role but could be around as low as 5% of the job (to not say zero) all the way to around 50% or even more in some cases. It comes down to sub-areas where you **must have** like appsec, sub-areas where you **should have** like security engineering and sub-areas where it is **nice to have** but might end up never using it like GRC or other more administrative role. Safe to say that will need eventually so better knowing and not needing than not knowing and ended up needing.

**Long version:**
Well it really depends, Information Security or even Cyber Security if you make the differentiation is a very broad field. Last time I've checked in a market research or [domain mapping](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cybersecurity-domain-map-ver-30-henry-jiang/) there were 52 unique roles (counting senior leadership and executives). Like any other field as you go up you will eventually get far away from the tools altogether requiring less and less affinity with coding.

The second are roles not directly hands-on. It is not expected that Antifraud Analysts or GRC Analysts (Governance, Risk and Compliance) know how to code, but if they do it is a nice to have as they can automate their own tasks or create tools that improve their delivery.

And lastly the engineering roles and other technical hands-on roles, where is expected or at least desired a minimum knowledge of coding. Security Engineers usually need notions of coding like Python or Shellscript to perform their day-to-day tasks or would be good if they have to automate the repetitive tasks. More on the infrastructure side you can see also automation stuff (that can be argued not actually being 'programming' intrinsically) like Ansible, Terraform, CloudFormation (AWS), policy as code, containers and its manifests (dockerfiles, helm, kubernetes config files), etc. You do not necessarily need to know programming or programming logic to be able to navigate in this area but having a bare minimum would greatly improve your flexibility and productivity. More on the development side the bar for programming knowledge is quite higher. The security engineer in an appsec team might not be the one writting the code but will test it or review it and for that will need to know the programmimng language used in depth and also secure coding.

For other sub-areas like pentest, malware analysis, bug hunting or research a solid programming knowledge is fundamental since it is the essence of the day-to-day work.
