## How can I evaluate a degree program?

Before you do anything else, figure out if college is a good option for you. This is covered in depth under "What's better for breaking in to cybersecurity: college or certifications?" - because there is no singular answer.

If college is or might be the right option for you, you should search for colleges that meet the criteria you need - anything from cost, to region, to social scene, etc. - to start narrowing down the list. Once you have the list of colleges you would consider if the program is good, you should do the following - as a *minimum baseline* - for *every* program you are evaluating.

First, make sure all *programs* you selected would allow for your personal success. Are those courses you personally are interested in, and likely to succeed? Would there be major blockers to doing a specific degree - such as high math requirements for a Computer Science degree - that could hinder your success? If you weed out too many colleges at this state, you may want to revisit "What degree is right for me?"

Next, ask for their placement statistics, and clarify what conditions someone is "placed" with.

* Does that mean they're in the security field?
* Does that mean they're working anywhere?
* Does that include people that went on to other education?

You want to know how many people got into the field directly from their program, or get the best approximate of that. Don't fall for red herrings like "some students even went on to work at [some prestigious company]" - that means a minimum of two did over the history of the program, and you don't know what you have the same credentials as they did going in.

It may also help to know what companies the college has relationships with or may receive advisement from - but absolutely don't take these as a guarantee that *all* graduates will be able to work at those companies.

Finally, you should try to find an alumni that isn't currently employed by that university. Set up time with them to learn about what the program did and didn't do for them. What did it do well? What were it's shortcomings? Etc. This is a biased opinion and should be evaluated as such (people that failed out or didn't succeed from that program probably aren't going to spend time evangelizing it to you), but it's not from someone who has a stake in marketing to you. You can search for alumni on LinkedIn, ask for opinions in the Mentorship Monday thread, or ask the college itself for recommendations on who to talk to (though beware, they will definitely be sending you to someone who did well and had a great relationship with the staff).
