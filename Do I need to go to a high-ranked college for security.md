## Do I need to go to a high-ranked college for security?

No.

It's important not to over-index on the reputation of a given school to decide whether or not to get your degree there. Some people are *very* concerned about whether going to specific schools is necessary to break in, and I would want to dampen that slightly - finding the right way for *you* to succeed is more important than a 'brand-name' school, even if that means skipping college altogether.

That's not to *negate* this concern entirely. Sure, going to an Ivy League school is going to place you in higher regard than someone going to a state school by default (and some verticals *will* still care about that, such as FinTech), but it doesn't *preclude* you from finding relevant or even prestigious work. What you do with your education, what your contributions to the field are, and what capabilities you bring to the table will often matter more - even if getting initial interviews will be harder without a prestigious school on your resume.
