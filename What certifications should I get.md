## What certifications should I get?

It depends on what you are interested in, or roles you think you want to shoot for. common certification 'stack' recommended on r/cybersecurity is A+, Net+, and Sec+. This is a great recommendation for getting started in IT and who want to build towards many common cybersecurity careers.

This answer is in progress [here](https://github.com/r-cybersecurity/faq/issues/7). Until then, please ask certification questions in the weekly Mentorship Monday thread.
