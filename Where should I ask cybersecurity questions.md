## Where should I ask cybersecurity questions?

It depends. To help people with their individual security questions - including but not limited to: malware infections, getting hacked, threatening or suspicious emails, staying safe online, and other questions about *personal* security - the correct place to post is r/cybersecurity_help. Many of our mambers volunteer to help on that subreddit, and it is equipped with bots to help find related questions and get you results faster. For general personal/home cybersecurity discussion, there is also r/cybersecurity101.

r/cybersecurity is a general interest but professional cybersecurity community. Our members are mostly technical professionals and students working to enter the tech field. A good litmus test for asking questions on r/cybersecurity is: if the question is relevant to *the security of businesses*, it's likely relevant here. If it's not relevant, the moderators are happy to inform you of that and show you the best place to post.
