## How is the work-life balance in cybersecurity?

This is more tied to specific roles and companies you work for than it is "cybersecurity as a whole." But, let's break this down.

#### When are people expected to be working in this field?

Few roles in cybersecurity will require shift-based coverage, but SOC Analyst (a common role) likely will, so incidents can be identified in realtime. Some companies are large enough that their SOC can "follow the sun" with international offices, and only need a rotation to cover weekends - but not all companies can or will do this, and so some will require overnight workers.

Other times, roles will require oncall shifts, or need people available if an incident occurs. These could be Security Engineering roles, Incident Response, etc. These are fairly common, but they're not a strict requirement for being in the field.

Finally, some roles will almost certainly not require oncall or shift work, such as GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance).

#### How long do people work per week in this field?

This depends on the company you are working for. Some companies enforce policies about working a regular workday, and then checking out. These companies may offer a lot of PTO and encourage people to use PTO frequently. On the very edge here, some companies are transitioning or currently use a 4-day workweek (32h standard).

Other companies are, frankly, mismanaged. In tech, these companies may require employees to do excessive oncall work (frequent shifts or frequent pages), or work longer hours without adequate compensation.

Most companies walk in the middle ground - you'll work a normal week, and then once in a (hopefully long!) while there will be an incident or other event which requires your prompt attention off-hours. I encourage all readers to find a company that does right for you as an employee - once you're established in tech, you can afford to shop around.

#### How much time do people spend in other work or advancement in this field?

For breaking in to cybersecurity, this can be quite substantial. Getting a handful of certifications and little prior experience is usually not sufficient - you need a strong foundation to break into most cybersecurity roles, and this can either be through a *lot* of off-hours effort, or work up more gradually in your workplace.

Once you're in the field, many people in this field spend time off-hours developing their skills. This isn't a *requirement* to succeed in cybersecurity, but it can help you advance yourself and stay current with industry trends, especially if your employer does not provide time for professional development. Spending 5 hours per week is plenty to keep up with news and read emerging research, with 10 or more you can run some projects on top of that.
