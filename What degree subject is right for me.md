## What degree subject is right for me?

Cybersecurity is very wide, and any degree (even a cybersecurity degree!) cannot prepare you for every area of cybersecurity. Additionally, we cannot speak to specific degrees offered by specific colleges, so *please* evaluate this within the context of any degrees you are personally reviewing.

#### Cybersecurity Degrees

The main focus of these degrees will *often* be preparing you for roles in IT Security, Network Security, System Security, Forensics, and Penetration Testing. They may not get you 100% of the way to those roles unless you have prior experience in tech - depending on the strength of the program and your personal success - but they're often a good start. You will often see the most success pivoting towards IT Security and IT Security adjacent fields.

Pros: These are relatively specific degrees and can be good for people who are very sure cybersecurity is what they want to do, or have existing tech experience and want to migrate into cybersecurity.

Cons: These degrees will under-equip you for fields outside of cybersecurity. So, if cybersecurity isn't as good for you as you had hoped, you may have trouble pivoting to other roles, as you'll have only foundational knowledge of other parts of tech.

Considerations: These degrees will often involve some computer science and math, but neither will be learned at a depth that is comparable to Computer Science. Additionally, the quality and focus of these degrees can vary wildly, so pay extra attention to the risk involved.

#### Computer Science (CS) Degrees

The main focus of these degrees will be Computer Science, and prepare you for roles in and around software. There are software-adjacent fields in security which will benefit from a CS degree, such as DevSecOps, Application Security, Product Security, and Penetration Testing.

Pros: These are fairly established degree programs which may have a much longer reputation of producing good candidates, research, and more. These may also have longer-standing industry connections.

Cons: These degrees will under-quip you for roles in security, and therefore you will likely need to do independent studies, research, club activities, etc. that allow you to build a foundation in security.

Considerations: These degrees will involve a lot of computer science (obviously) and math. If math is going to be a problem for you, you may be better-served by finding a non-CS degree.

Notes on CS degrees with a security track: This is a common way that colleges extend their CS programs to offer security coursework. You will be expected to complete all the foundations in Computer Science (math-, theory-, and programming-heavy) in order to specialize around the 300-400 level courses. If you won't succeed in CS, you may struggle to succeed in a CS-with-security degree. However, these degree programs can be a great way to prepare you more directly for roles in and around software security - so if you know you like CS and might like security, this can be a good option to explore without locking yourself into security entirely.
