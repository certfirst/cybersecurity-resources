## Can I get into cybersecurity through self-study exclusively?

In the sense of "can I take these Udemy courses and get a job with no other experience or effort?" Not without a big sprinkling of nepotism, no. Short, minimally tested (if at all!), and nonstandard courses are not high impact in resumes or interviews, and insufficient for a job on their own. They can be great to help you build specific skills or competencies, of course! But they won't stand on their own.

In the sense of broader self-study, advancing yourself without certifications/degrees/professional experience, just good ol' research, practice, and projects to try to break into cybersecurity ... the answer is "yes," but in the sense of "anything is possible with enough time, grit, and money." Not that you should attempt this, as it's high risk, and could take years before you get lucky with an employer that's willing to take a chance on you (or you strike gold by making something exceptional that people pay for, and you become a self-made business owner).

While there are many winding paths into cybersecurity, this is an admittedly tough one.
