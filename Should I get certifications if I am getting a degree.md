## Should I get certifications if I am getting a degree?

It's never a bad thing to know more stuff, though you should consider the applicability of the certifications before you do so.

To illustrate: a common certification 'stack' recommended on r/cybersecurity is A+, Net+, and Sec+. This is a great recommendation for many roles leading up to or at the entry level of cybersecurity. However, if you are working on a Computer Science degree and are looking to build towards a software security job, are you going to be maximizing the benefit from two IT-centric degrees and one security foundations degree? Probably not - that doesn't mean you *can't* or *shouldn't* broaden your horizons, but that it will probably not be immensely useful to the specific area you are looking towards.

Conversely, if you are working on an IT degree and building towards IT security, those three certifications are going to be more relevant to your work - they may even be part of your degree program. If they aren't, consider whether or not they'd be redundant with what you are already *capable of demonstrating on your resume and in your work* - if you already are demonstrating what those certifications will educate you on and test you for, maybe you should look at other certifications which will help you *advance.*

Ultimately, the decision is up to you - do you have the money to spend, or when looking through jobs to apply to, is it clear that this will increase your standing as an applicant? Then yes, you probably should. If not, then it's more of a personal decision.
